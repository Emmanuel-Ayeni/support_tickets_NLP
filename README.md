 Twitter Support Ticket System (AI-Powered)

> A **Machine Learning–driven Support Ticket System** inspired by **Twitter’s customer service model**, built to analyze sentiment, prioritize issues, and assist support agents in real time.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project combines **social media integration**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **ticket management** to create an intelligent customer support solution.  

It automatically classifies and prioritizes user complaints from Twitter, routes them to agents, and even provides AI-assisted responses — boosting efficiency and user satisfaction.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎫 **Smart Ticket Creation** – Automatically captures tweets mentioning support issues.  
- 🤖 **ML-Powered Classification** – Uses NLP to detect issue type, urgency, and sentiment.  
- 💬 **AI-Assisted Replies** – Suggests responses for support agents using fine-tuned transformer models.  
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** – Visualizes issue categories, response times, and sentiment trends.  
- 🔔 **Real-time Notifications** – Alerts agents about new tickets or urgent complaints.  
- 🧠 **Auto-Prioritization** – High-severity issues move to the top of the queue.
